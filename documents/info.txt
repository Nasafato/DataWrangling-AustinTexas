Austin is the state capital of Texas, the Lone Star state. It is one of the largest cities in the United States (11th in metropolitan population)
and the fourth-largest in Texas. The city itself is situated along the Colorado River, at the intersection of four major ecological regions, which give 
Austin its uniquely diverse climate that embodies characteristics of both the desert and the tropics. It is a major tech and cultural hub, home of the
University of Texas, Austin, and, frankly, is somewhere I would have loved to have gone to college (though New York isn't shabby either). 

That's my reason for choosing it: a college town, with the state's best public university; a cultural gem, host of film and music festivals, home to artists
and writers; a tech hub, with video game studios, research facilities, and defense industry establishments alike. All of this nestled in a green oasis situated
in the Texan drylands.
